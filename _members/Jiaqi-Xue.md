I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department at University of Central Florida, advised by Prof. Qian Lou. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree at Chongqing University in 2022. My research interests lie in the field of machine learning security, particularly in trojan attack/defense for AI models and AI Privacy Protection.
